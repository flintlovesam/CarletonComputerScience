.output addNames.txt

select 'add -s "' || name || '"' from users;




PART 2

A: show for each user's name the playlists they own


select users.user_id, users.name, playlists.playlist_name from users join playlists on users.user_id=playlists.user_id;



B: show for each user's playlist the songs that are on that playlist.



select users.name, playlist_tracks.playlist_name, songs.title from users join playlist_tracks on users.user_id=playlist_tracks.user_id join songs on playlist_tracks.song_id=songs.sid;


( evans mod to avoid situation where we have someone with the same name- another work around for uniqueness is to have title and composer, so that if two diff songs have same title, database can distinguish between the two)
(notice difference is users.name versus users.user_id)

select users.user_id, playlist_tracks.playlist_name, songs.title from users join playlist_tracks on users.user_id=playlist_tracks.user_id join songs on playlist_tracks.song_id=songs.sid;






PART3 Finally create a command script in your designed command language that creates the playlists for the users currently in the beatles database and also adds the songs to their playlists.

select 'add -stuff "' || users.user_id, playlist_tracks.playlist_name, songs.title || '"' from users join playlist_tracks on users.user_id=playlist_tracks.user_id join songs on playlist_tracks.song_id=songs.sid;
