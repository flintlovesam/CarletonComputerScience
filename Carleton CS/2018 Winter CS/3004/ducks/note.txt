Why is stragety valueable

1)
In the strategy pattern we
see that the abstract class duck in this case
will have within it two calls to instantiate the interfaces
for its behavior types.

We will use these two objects, "FlyBehavior" & "QuackBehavior"
below in the setter functions
1) setFlyBehavior
2) setQuackBehavior
where we can dynamically attribute
the behavior at runtime with the variable that will be passed in
